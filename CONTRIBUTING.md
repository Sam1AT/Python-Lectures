### Step 1: Types of contributions
You can contribute to our notebook in several ways.<br>
This repo is a place to discuss and collaborate on python related lessons !<br>
Our small, but mighty üí™ team is maintaining this repo.

#### üì£ Discussions
Discussions are where we have conversations.
If you have a great new idea or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in [discussions](https://github.com/shadmehr-salehi/Python-Lectures/discussions).

#### üêû Issues
[Issues](https://github.com/shadmehr-salehi/Python-Lectures/issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with.
If you've found something that is missing in the notebook or noticed a bug, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing.<br>
If it's something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/shadmehr-salehi/Python-Lectures/issues/new/choose). <br>
We'll use the issue to have a conversation with you about your issue.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Pull requests
A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a way to suggest changes in our repository.<br>
When we merge those changes, your changes will apply immediately to our main repo.

  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
2. Install dependencies using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Step4: Commit your update

### Pull Request
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill out the PR template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
